# Bits of Cryptos

Bits of Cryptos is a React website that displays live data for cryptocurrencies. Users can log in or create an account through the website. The project is organized into two main folders:

1. **client**: This folder contains the frontend code for the React website.
2. **server**: This folder contains the backend code.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: You'll need Node.js to run the React frontend and the backend server.
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is used to manage dependencies.

> Note: To download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g npm
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Martingminchev/BitsofCryptos-Full-Stack-Website
   ```

2. Navigate to the `client` folder:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the website at `http://localhost:3000`.



   The backend server will be running since its hosted on Heroku.
